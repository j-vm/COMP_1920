# COMP - Project 6

For this project, you need to [install Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)

## Compile 

Build the `Main.java` file and everything will be setup.

## Run

Run the `Main.java` file and the program will be displayed in the console.

## Program

First provide the name of the file to be analyzed (fir, dotprod, or autcor);

Then say the function isolation desired;

At this point you will need to choose between 6 modes:

    - The first 2 generate a graphs;
    - The others increasingly structured simulated C versions of the isolated function (the number of inputs of the function must be provided).
    
The generated files are located at `output/"filename`.
